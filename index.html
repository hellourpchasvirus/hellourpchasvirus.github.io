            <li><strong>💥 GRU'S BLOG – Operation Cheeto Thunder 💥</strong></li>
            <li><em>Date: April 29th, 2025</em></li>

            <li><strong>Phase 1: Minion Mayhem Preparation</strong></li>
            <li>6:00 AM – Woke up, brushed teeth, threatened Kyle the dog for chewing my slippers again.</li>
            <li>6:10 AM – Briefed the minions. Kevin, Bob, and Stuart were ready. Dave was eating glue again.</li>
            <li>6:45 AM – We loaded the Fart Gun X into the banana-shaped stealth van.</li>
            <li>7:00 AM – Minion roll call: 37 present, 3 stuck in vending machine, 1 somehow on Mars.</li>

            <li><strong>Phase 2: Infiltrating Vector’s Lair</strong></li>
            <li>7:30 AM – Arrived at Vector’s lair. It's still obnoxiously orange and smells like Axe body spray.</li>
            <li>7:35 AM – Minions formed distraction squad. They sang “YMCA” while setting off confetti grenades.</li>
            <li>7:40 AM – I slipped past his laser grid using my “old man pretending to walk his cat” disguise.</li>
            <li>7:42 AM – Stuart got stuck in a duct. Bob tried to help. Now they’re both stuck. We left them.</li>
            <li>7:50 AM – I found it. The vault. A glowing room filled wall-to-wall with Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.</li>

            <li><strong>Phase 3: The Crunch Heard ‘Round the World</strong></li>
            <li>7:55 AM – I took a bite. Crunchy. Fiery. Glorious. My tongue screamed. My heart soared.</li>
            <li>7:56 AM – Vector appeared in his hover-jammies, yelling, “GRUUUUUUU!!!!” like a drama queen.</li>
            <li>7:57 AM – I pulled out the Fart Gun X. The minions ducked behind a vending machine full of pudding.</li>
            <li>7:58 AM – First shot: shockwave. Vector’s hair caught fire.</li>
            <li>7:59 AM – Second shot: half the lair disintegrated. The minions cheered. One started breakdancing.</li>
            <li>8:00 AM – Third shot: reality itself sneezed. Vector was erased from existence. The moon briefly winked.</li>

            <li><strong>Phase 4: The Aftermath</strong></li>
            <li>8:01 AM – Silence. Ashes. Smoke. Cheeto dust in the air. Only two things remained: me... and my toilet.</li>
            <li>8:02 AM – Kevin tried to eat the toilet, thinking it was a marshmallow throne.</li>
            <li>8:03 AM – Dave emerged from rubble with a melted popsicle and no pants. He looked proud.</li>
            <li>8:10 AM – I declared the mission a success. The minions agreed and started dancing to "Banana Phone."</li>

            <li><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></li>
            <li>Was it worth it? Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Would I use the Fart Gun X again? Only on Mondays or in Ohio.</li>
            <li>Is Vector gone forever? Hopefully.</li>
            <li>Am I banned from every taco place within a 500-mile radius? Yes.</li>

            <li><strong>Bonus Notes:</strong></li>
            <li>- The moon now smells vaguely of jalapeños.</li>
            <li>- I’m adding a seatbelt to my toilet just in case.</li>
            <li>- The minions have built a shrine to the last surviving bag of Cheetos.</li>
